        <h2>ABOUT CNN-LSTM</h2>
        <p>
          The fusion of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term
          Memory (LSTM) networks for sign language recognition involves
          integrating the strengths of both architectures to create a
          comprehensive model. The CNN extracts spatial features from static
          sign language images, capturing hand-shapes and gestures, while the
          LSTM processes the sequential output of the CNN to discern temporal
          dependencies in dynamic sign language sequences. The fusion occurs by
          combining the spatial and temporal features, typically through
          concatenation or element-wise addition, and the combined
          representation is used for final sign language recognition through
          additional fully connected layers. This integrated approach enables
          the model to simultaneously grasp the spatial details of individual
          frames and the temporal dynamics of gestures over time, resulting in
          enhanced accuracy and robustness in sign language recognition.
